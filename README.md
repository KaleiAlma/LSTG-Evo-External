# LuaSTG Evo External Libraries
This repo collects third-party dependencies for LuaSTG Evo,
and allows for building them separately from the engine by compiling static
libraries and packaging them and their headers as a zip file.

The idea is that one could get a pre-compiled version of all of these libraries
in order to not have to build all of these dependencies on their own.
